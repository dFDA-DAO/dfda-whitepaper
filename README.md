# ðŸ’Š The Decentralized FDA DAO

## A New and Improved FDA Mandate

The US Food and Drug Administration was created for the very important purpose of protecting and promoting human health and safety.  Unfortunately, the 1962 Congressional efficacy mandate that drives all FDA policies is terribly worded.  It's so flawed that it actually prevents the FDA from effectively carrying out its true purpose.&#x20;

It's currently mandated to ensure the "**efficacy of drugs."** This is obviously an ideal goal, but the only way to **perfectly** fulfill this mandate is to ensure that no one ever takes a new drug again.  That would 100% guarantee that no one ever has the opportunity to take a drug that may or may not be effective.&#x20;

In practice, we've seen a less absolutist interpretation of the mandate. Instead of completely rejecting all new treatments, they have instead exponentially increased the regulatory barrier. Since 1962, when the current **efficacy** mandate was adopted, the cost of bringing a new treatment to market has increased 15X (1521%).

So the 1962 efficacy mandate simply doesn't weigh the costs of the regulatory burden against the reduction in treatments that are an inevitable tradeoff.  If something costs twice as much, you can only afford to buy half as much.  This is precisely what we've seen in the 70% reduction in new therapies immediately following the modification.

[60 million](https://www.theworldcounts.com/populations/world/deaths) people die annually, and [2.5 billion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6214883/) suffer from chronic diseases.  To address this, the new and improved outcome-focused mandate of the Decentralized Food and Drug Administration (deFDA) is to **maximize the average healthy human lifespan as measured by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)**.

## Hypotheses

1. Given a clear and optimized mandate, the crowd wisdom of a large body of medical experts can produce policies that are more effective at extending healthy human lifespan than the current regulatory framework.
2. Implementing such a regulatory body in a microstate or economic zone like Prospera, a semi-autonomous jurisdiction in Honduras is possible.
3. Evidence of the success of this model will make it possible to promote adoption by other micronations.
4. Evidence of the success of this model will make it possible to promote adoption by increasingly larger states.
